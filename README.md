## Introduction

### Introduction To The Dataset 

Our project covers various stages, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and building both baseline and final models, culminating in a fairness analysis. 

The primary questions we aim to answer are: 

**1. How does the nutritional content of a recipe influence its average rating?**

**2. How have trends in healthy eating habits evolved over the years based on the nutritional content of the recipes?**

### Why This Matters

Food is an integral part of our lives, bringing us joy and fulfillment, especially for avid bakers like myself. In recent years, there's been a noticeable shift towards healthier eating habits, driven by a growing awareness of the impact of diet on overall well-being. This inspired me to analyse how the nutritional content of recipes affect their popularity and satisafaction levels. By diving into this data from [food.com](https://www.food.com/), we uncover valuable insights for both consumers and recipe creators.
